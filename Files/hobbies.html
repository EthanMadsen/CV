  <h3>Hobbies</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Guitar: </strong>I have been playing for around 15 years.
                Pre-COVID I was keen on playing solo/with friends in bands at open mics etc.</li>
            <li><strong><a href="https://www.lykewakewalk.co.uk/">Hiking</a></strong> :I have completed the Lyke Wake Walk challenge as well as various
                DofE award expeditions in the UK, but mostly I enjoy casual walks on the longer side.</li>
            <li><strong>Travel: </strong>Whether solo, with friends or with family.
            Recently while on the JET programme I have been exploring various parts of southern Japan (not quite Okinawa yet!)</li>
            <li><strong>Games: </strong>Whether it's cards, like Bridge or Hearts, or couch co-op console gaming, if it's
            a game I probably like it!</li>
